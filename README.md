Multiplication Table (for + variables)
Ask the user for a number n.
Use a for loop to print the multiplication table of n from 1 to 10.
Example line: “n x i = result”.
Sum Until Stop (while + if)
Continuously prompt for numbers and keep a running total in a variable.
If the user types “stop” (or empty input), break the loop and print the total.
If input isn’t a valid number, print an error and keep asking.
Count Vowels (for + if)
Ask the user for a word or sentence.
Loop through each character with a for loop.
Count vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and print the total count at the end.
Simple ATM Menu (while + if/elif + variables)
Start with a balance variable (e.g., 100.0).
In a while loop, show a menu: 1) Check balance 2) Deposit 3) Withdraw 4) Exit.
Use if/elif to handle choices, update balance on deposit/withdraw, and validate amounts (no negative numbers; no overdraft).
